	- Bugfix (major): Fixed a problem caused when adding a very large number of URLs to a sitemap.  
		All the URIs for SitemapBuilder were stored in RAM.  Now a temp sqlite database is created,
		and URI data is stored there.  The database is deleted after your script exits.	

0.9.1
	- Bugfix (major):  Fixed error that caused type validation error when 'base_url' was overridden in site configuration.
		The value read out of the configuration file was not being properly converted to a URI object, instead it was
		passed to SitemapBuilder as a string, which failed validation.
